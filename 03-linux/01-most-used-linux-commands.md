## Question  
What are 10 Linux commands you use daily? (Excluding basic ones like `ls` and `cd`)

### 📝 Short Explanation  
This question aims to assess your hands-on experience with Linux, focusing on diagnostic, file manipulation, service management, and automation-related commands that go beyond basic navigation.

## ✅ Answer  
Here are 10 Linux commands I use regularly, excluding the basics like `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`:

---

### 1. `tail -f/cat/less`  
```bash
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
🔍 Monitor log files in real time — very useful for debugging issues as they happen.

---

### 2. `grep`  
```bash
grep -i "timeout" /var/log/app.log
```
🔎 Search through files, logs, or command outputs for specific patterns. I use this to quickly isolate errors.

---

### 3. `systemctl`  
```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```
🛠️ Control system services — starting, stopping, checking status of systemd services.

---

### 4. `journalctl`  
```bash
journalctl -u docker.service -f
```
🧾 View logs for systemd-managed services. Especially handy for debugging issues with services like Docker or Kubelet.

---

### 5. `ps aux | grep/top/htop`  
```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```
📋 List running processes. I use this to find rogue or resource-intensive processes.

---

### 6. `df -h` / `du -sh`  
```bash
df -h       # Check available disk space  
du -sh *    # See folder sizes in current directory
```
💾 Essential for disk space monitoring and cleaning up large files or folders.

---

### 7. `chmod` / `chown`  
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh  
chown ubuntu:ubuntu script.sh
```
🔐 Manage file permissions and ownership — very common in CI/CD and provisioning tasks.

---

### 8. `find`  
```bash
find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime +7
```
🔍 Locate files based on name, date, type, etc. Great for automating cleanup or audits.

---

### 9. `curl`  
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080
```
🌐 Test web endpoints, APIs, or service availability from the command line.

---

### 10. `rsync`  
```bash
rsync -avz /app/ user@server:/backup/
```
📁 Efficient file syncing and backup — much faster and more reliable than `scp` for large directories.

---

### 11. `scp`  
```bash
scp file.txt user@remote_host:/path/destination
```
📁 Securely transfer files and directories between systems over a network using SSH encryption.
